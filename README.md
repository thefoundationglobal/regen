Github mirror (from Codeberg):
I have played around with it quite a bit and it seems that for mirroring from github to codeberg (the other way alreahyÂ works) we will need a local machine or paid gitlab, which we intend to set up soon

if you want to contribute, please do so through codeberg.org/thefoundation/regen
